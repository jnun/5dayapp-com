# ✅ Setup Complete!

## What Was Built

A **secure Next.js application** with server-side Mailgun integration for the 5dayapp.com landing page.

## Key Files

### Next.js App (in `nextjs-app/` directory)
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page (converted from index.html)
- `app/components/ContactForm.tsx` - Contact form component
- `app/api/contact/route.ts` - **Secure API endpoint** (API key hidden here)
- `app/globals.css` - All styling (converted from styles.css)
- `.env.local` - **Environment variables** (contains your Mailgun API key)
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables

### Old Files (for reference)
- `index.html` - Original static HTML (can delete after testing)
- `styles.css` - Original CSS (can delete after testing)  
- `script.js` - Original JS with exposed API key (can delete after testing)
- `pitch.html` - Pitch deck (keep this, still works)

## Security Improvement

### Before ❌
```javascript
// API key exposed in browser JavaScript
'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('api:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')
```

### After ✅
```typescript
// API key stored server-side in .env.local
Authorization: `Basic ${Buffer.from(`api:${process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY}`).toString('base64')}`
```

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy Next.js App (Recommended)
```bash
cd nextjs-app
```
Follow instructions in `nextjs-app/DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Option 2: Keep Testing Locally
```bash
cd nextjs-app
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

These are stored in `nextjs-app/.env.local`:
```env
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mail.5dayapp.com
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@5dayapp.com
MAILGUN_TO_EMAIL=jason@upgrademedia.com
```

**When deploying to Vercel:** Add these as environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, NOT in your code.

**Note:** See `nextjs-app/.env.local` for the actual values (this file is gitignored for security).

## Testing

✅ **Tested locally** - Dev server ran successfully
✅ **API endpoint working** - POST /api/contact returns 200
✅ **Form validated** - React form with proper state management
✅ **Secrets protected** - API key stored in .env.local (gitignored)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the contact form locally:**
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-app && npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000, fill out form, check jason@upgrademedia.com

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Push `nextjs-app/` to GitHub
   - Import in Vercel
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy!

3. **Point domain:**
   - In Vercel, add custom domain `5dayapp.com`
   - Update DNS records

## What Changed From Original Request

You initially wanted to keep the static HTML/CSS/JS files, but they had the Mailgun API key exposed in the browser. 

GitHub correctly blocked the push because exposing API keys is a security vulnerability - anyone could steal your key and send unlimited emails from your domain.

The Next.js solution:
- ✅ Keeps your Mailgun setup (you already pay for it)
- ✅ Hides API key server-side
- ✅ Same design and functionality
- ✅ Free to deploy on Vercel
- ✅ Takes 5 minutes to deploy

## Questions?

- **Why Next.js?** - Needed a backend to hide the API key securely
- **Why not a simple form service?** - You wanted to use your existing Mailgun setup
- **What about the old files?** - Keep them for now, delete after confirming Next.js version works
